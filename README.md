# AWS ROG Explorer

![Concept](ec2_example.gif)

## Overview
**AWS ROG Explorer** is a futuristic, 3D interactive interface designed for managing and visualizing AWS cloud infrastructure. Built specifically for handheld gaming devices like the **ROG Ally**, it replaces the traditional mouse-and-keyboard console with a tactical, gamepad-first experience powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of **Google Gemini's** advanced reasoning and code generation capabilities. The entire application—including the 3D engine implementation, multi-service AWS backend logic, and structured AI remediation workflows—was architected and generated by Gemini in just a few hours.

Instead of digging through AWS Console tables, you fly through a 3D star-map of your EC2 instances, ECR repositories, and Lambda functions. When security anomalies are detected, the system shifts into a high-visibility alert state, and the built-in AI Consultant delivers real-time voice briefings on how to fix vulnerabilities.

## Key Features

### 🌐 3D Network Visualization (X-Ray Mode)
*   **Live Traffic Pulse:** EC2 nodes physically grow and pulse based on real-time VPC Flow Log data, similar to AWS X-Ray. Larger nodes = higher traffic.
*   **Star Map Layout:** Resources are arranged in a 3D spherical grid for intuitive navigation via analog sticks, optimized for handheld interaction.
*   **Visual Status:** Nodes glow based on health and security posture, allowing for immediate identification of hotspots.

### 🛡️ Inspector 2 Security Command
*   **Real-time Vulnerability Overlay:** In **Security Mode**, the grid highlights high-risk targets.
*   **ECR Deep Scan:** Repositories with critical CVEs turn bright RED.
*   **AI Consultant:** Select a node to trigger a **Deep Dive**. The system aggregates findings from **AWS Inspector 2**, **AWS GuardDuty**, and **Security Hub**, then utilizes Google Gemini to generate a human-centric manual remediation guide.
*   **Voice Briefing:** A text-to-speech assistant reads a concise summary of the findings aloud while ducking the background music, providing a hands-free security overview.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  **Python 3.10+**
2.  **AWS Credentials:** Configured via `aws configure` (The app uses your default profile).
3.  **Google Gemini API Key:** Required for AI features.

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rog_aws_crawling.git
    cd rog_aws_crawling
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Add your Gemini Key:**
    Create a file named `gemini_token.txt` in the root directory and paste your API key inside.
    *(Note: This file is git-ignored for security).*

### Running the Explorer
```bash
python main.py
```

## Security Note
This application runs strictly locally. It connects directly to your AWS account using your local credentials. **No data is sent to any third-party server** other than the specific anonymized security findings sent to Google Gemini for analysis during a Deep Dive.
